***HWID***  
  
***How To Bypass HWID Bans?***  
- All games with HWID are different. There is no real HWID as HWID is just a bunch of information from your computer stuck together. Therefore different AntiCheats uses different HWIDs. To Bypass this is quite easy for most anti cheats, there are HWID spoofers all around the internet if you take your time to find it. Please note that not all HWID spoofer might get rid of the HWID bans as different AC uses different HWID and the HWID spoofer you are using might not spoof the things the anti cheat is looking for.  
  
***What Are HWID Bans?***  
- HWID Bans are basically a ban which involves your PC instead of the old IP Ban. What Anti Cheats do is basically gather information from your PC such as your OS, GPU Details, Hard Driver Serial, Mac Address and other information about your PC and once you get banned, they blacklist your HWID. Meaning you cant play the game on the same PC anymore. This is usually seen in free games as if you get banned you could just make another account for free instead of buying an account. This can be bypassed by just buying a new PC or using something called a HWID Spoofer. Which just spoofs your parts of your computer IDs.  
  
***What Is HWID Flagging?***  
- Getting HWID Flagged by a Anti Cheat means alot of things. Some Anti Cheat like used in Rainbow 6, what they do is basically, if you got banned before they gather your hwid and store it in their servers. This will basically make it so that if you trigger maybe 3 detection or something the anti cheat thinks that you are doing wrong, you will get banned compared to maybe 5 detection compared to normal users with their HWID not Flagged. Anti Cheat also does other things like HWID bans and such, but this is quite debatable among different anti cheats.

***VAC - Valve Allows Cheats***  
  
***What Is Vac?***  
-Valve Anti-Cheat, abbreviated to VAC, is an anti-cheat solution developed by Valve Corporation as a component of the Steam game development platform, first released with Counter-Strike 1.4 in 2002. During one week of November 2006, the system detected over 10,000 cheating attempts. As of 2012, it is estimated that over 1.5 million Steam accounts have been banned by VAC and over 2.2 million accounts banned in December 2014. As of 2013, it is used in over 60 games on Steam.  
  
-There are at least 10 known instances of the system kicking or banning for false detections. Most notably in July 2010, approximately 12,000 owners of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 were falsely banned.  
  
-When the software detects a cheat on a players system, it will ban them in the future, possibly days or weeks after the original detection. It may kick players from the game if it detects errors in their system's memory or hardware. No information such as date of detection or type of cheat detected is disclosed to the player.  
  
[Credits.](https://www.unknowncheats.me/wiki/Valve_Anti-Cheat)  
  
-VAC stands for Valve Anti-Cheat, an automated system designed to detect cheats installed on users' computers. If a user connects to a VAC-Secured server from a computer with identifiable cheats installed, the VAC system will ban the user from playing that game on VAC-Secured servers in the future.  
  
-The VAC system reliably detects cheats using their cheat signatures. Any third-party modifications to a game designed to give one player an advantage over another is classified as a cheat or hack and will trigger a VAC ban. This includes modifications to a game's core executable files and dynamic link libraries.  
  
-While server admins may choose to ban specific players, server admins cannot VAC ban players.

[Extra Information](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1y0kc1/vac_now_reads_all_the_domains_you_have_visited/)  
  
***How Does It Work?***  
-Well, VAC mainly does signature scanning, it scans a function's signature and compares it to blacklisted signatures. This is usually why you don't just paste codes and functions into your own cheats. They also check what domains you have visited (DNS). To avoid this, just type in ``ipconfig /flushdns`` in your cmd.   
  
***How To Bypass VAC?***  
-To start off, VAC isnt hard to bypass if you are willing to make the cheat private and are willing to just selfcode it. Self Coding your own cheat can basically help you out alot as VAC wont really have the signatures to scan for. Other things you could do is adding Junk Codes or using programs such as VMProtect ( Aint 100% if it Works ). Vac should not be a problem for you if you know what you are doing or know how to code your own hacks. If you just starting Cheating and wanted to make your own cheat, you can possibly get a public hack source code and just add junk code to it and also re-coding some functions. VAC also runs in usermode.  
  
***What I Feel About VAC.***  
- I personally feel that VAC is a decent anti cheat from public cheats or paid cheats. Vac are doing their jobs by detecting many public cheats and paid cheats months after months. I feel like VAC could be better, but they are being abit too careful i would say, trying to avoid false bans and only allowing bans which only gets triggered when the user is 100% cheating.

***Battle-Eye***  
  
***Information About Battle-Eye***  
  
-BattlEye (BE) was founded by Bastian Suter in October 2004. Starting out as an external 3rd-party anti-cheat for Battlefield Vietnam, first versions were quickly released and it rapidly gained first acknowledgement. In early 2005, it was integrated in the first professional leagues. Due to request by the community, BattlEye was then ported to Battlefield 1942 and again used by some leagues.  
  
-The breakthrough came a few months later, when BattlEye was newly developed for the highly anticipated Battlefield 2. After its release in June 2005, the demand for BattlEye from a huge and active community grew more and more and it soon was integrated in many leagues (including all large German ones). From time to time, many server admins decided to protect their public servers with the system as well.  
  
-In 2006, BattlEye was directly integrated into a game, called Warsow – a popular freeware FPS, with official support from the developers for the first time. It now ran internally in the game, allowing a far better detection of cheats/hacks than with the external solution for the Battlefield series before. Support for the popular indie title Soldat then came in the same way.  
  
-In 2007 and 2008, BattlEye was integrated into the successful commercial multiplayer games ArmA: Armed Assault / Combat Operations and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, marking a new huge milestone. Support for critically acclaimed ArmA 2 and its standalone extension ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead followed in 2009 and 2010, setting the stage for BattlEye protecting the hugely popular DayZ mod being released in 2012. In the same year it was also integrated into the WWII game Iron Front: Liberation 1944.  
  
-Finally, in 2013 BattlEye was added to the biggest Arma-series game to date, Arma 3, and the well-known DayZ standalone game. Fighting cheaters in all games with success, at some point it was obvious that BattlEye had the potential to be more than a traditional anti-cheat that only kicks or bans players after the damage has already been done. Consequently, BattlEye transformed into a proactive system in late 2014 completely preventing most cheating from happening. This marked the biggest milestone so far.  
  
-The cheater-plagued DayZ community has confirmed many times that cheating has been reduced to an absolute minimum ever since the new proactive system was introduced in February 2015. Mission: Success! Being passionate about protecting games for almost 11 years, we are looking forward to assisting game developers in their fight against selfish cheaters for many decades to come.

***How Does Battle-Eye Work?***  
  
-Started late 2014, Battle-Eye inserted a kernel module named ``BEDaisy.sys`` on the Arma Series games. This originally started on Arma 2 but then later moved to DayZ SA and then finally Arma 3. The large impact of the kernel module is the ``OBRegisterCallback`` ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/lib...v=vs.85).aspx)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff558692(v=vs.85).aspx)) they set on the game. This callback brings handle access down to almost nothing. Because you do not have privileges to access the process's memory, ``WriteProcessMemory``, ``ReadProcessMemory`` and any other WinAPI function that requires a handle with a generally open access will fail. There are many ways to get around this though. You can refer to the dump of the driver to see exactly what they do.

***How To Bypass Battle-Eye?***  
  
- Drivers: Drivers are quite hard to start off with. Drivers are basically the gods of the OS, they can do everything you want it to do. You might ask, well why not just make all cheats drivers? firstly, Battleye already has measures against drivers, they dumb unsigned drivers and also check for prev loaded drivers and so on. Signing a driver isnt free by the way. Making a driver also is not easy, one fuck up can cause BSOD and just fuck up the PC. One more thing, Windows doesnt allow you to load unsigned drivers, they only allow you to load in test mode, and games with battleye does not run in test mode. There are ways to get rid of the protection that windows has made ( just seach google ).  
  
- ``Lsass.exe``: This bypass requires you to abuse a program called "lsass.exe", this program is a window's program and guess what, it stores handles to pretty much all the programs running in the computer. This program, if closed, will crash the computer. This is a important program therefore anti cheats can't really mess with it. The handles inside lsass.exe also cant be stripped, also making it so that anti cheats cant do much. This bypass is quite simple, just injecting into ``lsass.exe`` and getting the list of handles ``lsass.exe`` has and filtering the handles to the ones you want. After getting the handle, thats it. you can inject into the game using ahem shell code injection or any injection method you want. But, in the recent months, Battle-Eye has been doing some things like checking for named pipe handles, checking for new threads and other things.

***What I Feel About Battleye.***  
  
- Well, pretty sure battleye is one of the best anti cheat out there. Battleye also runs in ring 0, which means it can pretty much strips handles. I spent one of the time in this anti cheat as it really gave me a headache. Other then that, the anti cheat is actually extremely good and it does it's job well.

***How Does Face-It Work?***

- The driver cannot be stopped while the FACEIT client is open, but you can stop it if the client in closed, if you try and open the client while the driver is stopped it'll demand you restart but you can just start the driver right before you open FACEIT client.  
  
- The driver installs the following notification routines.  
  
- It does not use the ``ObProcess`` notification routine to block handle access to the game at all, which means it likely using it as a handle logger but it does appear to use them for blocking any access attempts to faceitclient.exe. Attempting to disable or remove the callbacks will cause a BSOD when logging into the FACEIT client as well.  
  
- The driver appears to be passing information down to user mode using MDLs which leads me to believe they're scanning kernel memory but how extensive the scans are, that I don't know.  
  
- The client has references to API such as...  
Code: 
```

***What I Feel About Face-It?***  
  
- Well, my feelings towards Face-It is quite numb. Never used it nor did i try to temper with it. I feel like Face-It is just a Battleye for games like CS:GO and afew others. When i was doing research about the anti cheat, i found out that Face-It was harder then alot of Anti Cheats out there.

***Easy Anti-Cheat***  
  
***What is Easy Anti-cheat?***  
  
-Easy Anti Cheat abbreviated to EAC, is an Anti-Cheat used in Multiplayer games.  
The tool was developed in 2006 and is used by different multiplayer server hosters in Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike, Counter Strike: Condition Zero, Counter Strike: Source, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Magica: Wizard Wars, War of The Roses and War of The Vikings.  
The tool might as well be taken into use in the popular FPS game "Rust".  
  
-There was given information that the tool may as well start supporting SteamOS at the end of 2015. EAC may also be released for Linux, if cheating becomes a problem there.  
So Far only Windows systems support EAC.  
EAC Cheat Detection has a automated data analysis and cheat prevention with global ban list.  
  
[Credits](https://www.unknowncheats.me/wiki/Easy_Anti_Cheat)  
  
***How Does EAC Works?***  
  
- You guessed it! Drivers....they strip handle permissions to their game using ``ObRegisterCallbacks``. They also block some injection methods as well. They basically check for Handle creations and strip their permissions for Read And Write. This can be avoided using ``Lsass`` method. EAC also has signature scanning and they have implemented things to stop AHK scripts and other macros. They also check for loaded modules and checked in mapped regions. Creating a new thread will also get you a ban.

Signing a driver isnt free by the way. Making a driver also is not easy, one fuck up can cause BSOD and just fuck up the PC. One more thing, Windows doesnt allow you to load unsigned drivers, they only allow you to load in test mode, and games with battleye does not run in test mode. There are ways to get rid of the protection that windows has made ( just seach google ).  
  
- Lsass.exe: This bypass requires you to abuse a program called "lsass.exe", this program is a window's program and guess what, it stores handles to pretty much all the programs running in the computer. This program, if closed, will crash the computer. This is a important program therefore anti cheats can't really mess with it. The handles inside lsass.exe also cant be stripped, also making it so that anti cheats cant do much. This bypass is quite simple, just injecting into lsass.exe and getting the list of handles lsass.exe has and filtering the handles to the ones you want. After getting the handle, thats it. you can inject into the game using ahem shell code injection or any injection method you want. But, in the recent months, Battle-Eye has been doing some things like checking for named pipe handles, checking for new threads and other things.
